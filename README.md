### 🔌​ Sensor configuration

The sensor configuration allows adjustment of four essential parameters to optimize the accuracy of the sensor:

- Distance from the sensor to the projected screen.
- Distance from the middle of the sensor to the left edge of the screen.
- Distance from the middle of the sensor to the right edge of the screen.
- Height of the projected screen.

These settings are key to ensuring that the sensor operates accurately, adapting to the physical characteristics of the installation and improving the user experience.
